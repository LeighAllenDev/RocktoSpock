# Rock to Spock!

**Code Institute** Learner Project 02

## Site Overview

Rock to Spock is my take on the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game with the added rules from the popular TV show:

**The Big Bang Theory**

The aim of the site is to allow the user to play rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock agaianst the Computer to determine the winner of the game, the first to reach the score limit of 10 Wins!.

### The Rules

The rules of the game are as follows: 
- Rock crushes Scissors
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes Lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes Scissors
- Scissors decapetate Lizard
- Lizard eats Paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes Rock

### Technologies and Challenges
For this project I used a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the design and functionality of this game. This is my first project using JavaScript and it came with many challenges but overall I'm proud of the result. 

During this project, I faced issues with the JavaScript just not working, and had to watch many tutorials to get explanations of why functions weren't behaving the way I had hoped.

A future implementation I would like to achieve with this project is to make it payable between two users as an option rather than just playing against the computer.
